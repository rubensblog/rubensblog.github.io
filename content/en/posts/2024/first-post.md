## My Transition to a Minimalist Blog

Recently, I made a decision: I want to make my blog more minimalist and move away from the extensive WordPress system. WordPress is a great tool that offers countless features and customization options, but it has become too extensive for me and no longer fits my minimalist lifestyle.

That's why I've decided to switch from WordPress to static pages. Static pages are much lighter and less complex, which perfectly suits my minimalist life. Instead of dealing with plugins, updates, and maintenance, I want to see if I can run my blog using simple, static HTML pages.

I'm excited to share this journey with you and see where it takes me. I will soon publish more information and insights here on the blog, so stay tuned!

See you soon!
