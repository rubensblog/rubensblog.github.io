## First Version Online â€“ The Start of a New Project

Last night, I worked late on the system and finally pushed it to Git. Now, the first version is online! The design is minimal, and I quite like it. Of course, there's always room for improvement, and I'll continue to develop it in the future.

I find the approach of publishing a website via a Git server particularly exciting. It's simple, fast, and offers a great way to track changes and continuously improve.

What comes next? Time will tell. I had a short night, but there's still a lot of work to do. Stay tuned and see how this project evolves! It's definitely going to be an exciting journey.
